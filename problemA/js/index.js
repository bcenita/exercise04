'use strict';

/** Basic Types */

//Define a new variable `motto` for the value "The iSchool is my school"


//Log out the motto


//Define a variable `mottoLength` that stores the length of the motto.
//Use the `.length` property
//Log out the length


//Use the `indexOf()` String method to see if the word "cool" is in the string.
//See http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp for String methods
//Log out a boolean whether it is or not


//Replace the word "iSchool" in the motto with the words "Information School".
//This new value should _replace_ the `motto` variable's value
//Log out the new motto


//Calculate the ratio between the length of the new motto and the length of the 
//old. Log out this ratio as a percentage with two decimal places of precision
//(e.g., `"123.45%"`).
//You can use the `.toFixed()` number method. 



/** Arrays **/

//Create an array `numbers` that contains the first 10 decimals of Pi
//(e.g., 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5).
//Log out the array


//Use bracket notation to change the `4` in the array to a `4.2`.
//Log out the updated array


//Add the number 3 to the end of the array.
//Log out the updated array


//Find the median (middle) value of the numbers in the array.
//Hint: sort() the array, then access the middle index of the sorted values.
//Log out the median value 



/** Objects **/

//Create a variable `rect` that represents a rectangle. This should be an Object
//with properties:
//  `x` (coordinate) of 30, `y` of 50, `width` of 100, `height` of 50
//Log out the rectangle object


//Log out the x- and y- coordinates of the rectangle (its location). Your output 
//should have the format `"X, Y"`.


//Set the rectangle's height to be the square root of its width. Use Math.sqrt()
//Use *dot notation* to access the properties!


//Log out the rectangle's area. Use *dot notation* to access the properties!


//Create a variable `circle` that represents a circle. This should be an object
//with properties
//  `cx` (center-x-coordinate) of 34, 
//  `cy` of 43, and
//  `radius` equal to the LAST value in the (sorted) `numbers` array.
//Log out the circle


//Create an array `shapes` that represents a list of shapes. The array should
//contain the rectangle and the circle objects defined above.
//Log out the variable. Be sure to inspect it in the developer console!


//Add a new ANONYMOUS object to the `shapes` array representing a right triangle.
//The triangle should have a `base` of 33 and a `height` of 44.
//Log out the updated shapes array


//Log out the triangle's `hypotenuse` property. Determine why you got that result.


//Assign the triangle inside the `shapes` array a 'hypotenuse' property of 55
//Log out the `shapes` array again.
//Check: what happens if you inspect the previously logged array in the Chrome
//developer console?
